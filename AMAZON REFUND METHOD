Method #1 - I didn't receive the package

The most common method or excuse that will get you whatever you want if it's below $100 - $300. Go to chat or phone (phone is overkill if you use this method), tell them "hey rep, I have a problem with this order. I didn't receive it" The rep will most likely refund it right away or send a replacement, or maybe after asking you if you checked with your neighbours and family members, which in this case just say you already did, or you don't have family members.

Pros: Easy and basic. Cons: You can't really use these on large items (by size) or expensive items starting from $700+ without getting into an investigation.```
Method # 2 - "I receive nothing inside the package 

Only use this method when in the tracking, or when you receive it, the item was "SIGNED" upon receiving. This will get you from $100 - $500 or depending upon the level of the rep. The rep will ask for an investigation WITH the carrier, but before he can do that, tell the rep that you "already called the carrier, and they told me it they didn't do anything and it was already like that when they delivered it" When they ask if the package was tampered or not, tell them it is perfectly sealed and no tampering. Pros: If method #1 doesn't work for you, this will. Cons: They will most likely attempt to do an investigation, depending upon the price and the rep.```
Method #3 --- "Return Method / Box method

You get the label for returns, ship them an empty box, or a few bricks.

Pros: will work, most likely.

Cons: the hassle of the process.
